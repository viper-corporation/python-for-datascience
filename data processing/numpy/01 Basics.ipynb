    "Numerical Python (NumPy) is a successor to the Numeric package. It was originally written by Travis Oliphant to be the foundation of a scientific computing environment in Python. It branched off from the much wider SciPy module in early 2005 and had its first stable release in mid-2006. Since then, it has enjoyed growing popularity among Pythonists who work in the mathematics, science, and engineering fields. The goal of this book is to make you conversant enough with NumPy so that you're able to use it and can build complex scientific applications with it."

    "A fundamental question that beginners ask is. Why are arrays necessary for scientific computing at all? Surely, one can perform complex mathematical operations on any abstract data type, such as a list. The answer lies in the numerous properties of arrays that make them significantly more useful. In this section, let's go over a few of these properties to emphasize why something such as the NumPy ndarray object exists at all."

    "### Representing of matrices and vectors\n",
    "The abstract mathematical concepts of matrices and vectors are central to many scientific problems. Arrays provide a direct semantic link to these concepts. Indeed, whenever a piece of mathematical literature makes reference to a matrix, one can safely think of an array as the software abstraction that represents the matrix. In scientific literature, an expression such as $A_{ij}$ is typically used to denote the element in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column of array `A`. The corresponding expression in NumPy would simply be `A[i,j]`. For matrix operations, NumPy arrays also support **vectorization** (details are addressed later, Using NumPy Arrays), which speeds up execution greatly. Vectorization makes the code more concise, easier to read, and much more akin to mathematical notation. Like matrices, arrays can be multidimensional too. Every element of an array is addressable through a set of integers called indices, and the process of accessing elements of an array with sets of integers is called **indexing**. This functionality can indeed be implemented without using arrays, but this would be cumbersome and quite unnecessary."

    "### Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency can mean a number of things in software. The term may be used to refer to the speed of execution of a program, its data retrieval and storage performance, its memory overhead (the memory consumed when a program is executing), or its overall throughput. NumPy arrays are better than most other data structures with respect to almost all of these characteristics (with a few exceptions such as pandas, DataFrames, or SciPy's sparse matrices, which we shall deal with later). Since NumPy arrays are statically typed and homogenous, fast mathematical operations can be implemented in compiled languages (the default implementation uses C and Fortran). Efficiency (the availability of fast algorithms working on homogeneous arrays) makes NumPy popular and important."

The NumPy API is so flexible that it has been adopted extensively by the scientific Python community as the standard API to build scientific applications. Examples of how this standard is applied across scientific disciplines can be found in _The NumPy Array: a structure for efficient numerical computation, Van Der Walt_, and others:"

The first element in array `x` is multiplied by the first element in array `y` and so on. One important point to note here is that the arithmetic operations between two NumPy Arrays are not matrix multiplications. The result still returns the same shape of NumPy Arrays.

    "Two variables, `x` and `y`, are the same length and do the same kind of work, which includes adding a value to all the elements in the arrays. With the help of NumPy operations, the performance is way faster than an ordinary Python `for` loop (we use a list comprehension here for neat code, which is faster than an ordinary Python `for` loop, but still, NumPy has better performance when compared to the ordinary Python `for` loop). Knowing this huge distinction can help you speed up your code by replacing your loops with NumPy operations."
